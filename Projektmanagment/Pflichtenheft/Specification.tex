\noindent This template can be used to create Software Requirements Specifications that conform to IEEE Standard 830-1993. \\[-0.3cm]

\noindent An SRS is a tool for capturing requirements on a project; it is the epitome of “plain language requirements”. Although an SRS is designed to stand on its own, most projects will employ additional tools for capturing requirements. An SRS may be ancillary or unnecessary on many projects, but a partial or lightweight one may be quite useful even if other techniques are being used to capture the bulk of the requirements. \\[-0.3cm]

\noindent Consider using an SRS when: \\[0.1cm]
Modeling techniques need to be augmented \\[0.1cm]
Plain language is the best mechanism for capturing system behavior \\[0.1cm]
Requirements must be traceable \\[0.1cm]

\noindent For each required software product, provide identification information including at least name, version number, and source. \\[-0.3cm]

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Annahmen und Abhängigkeiten}
List factors that affect the requirements. These factors are not design constraints, but areas where future changes might drive change in the requirements.

\subsection{Realisierung der Anforderungen}
Identify any requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system.

\newpage

\section{Externe Schnittstellen}
From this section on all software requirements should be described at a sufficient level of detail for designers to design a system satisfying the requirements and testers to verity that the system satisfies requirements. \\[-0.3cm]

\noindent The organization of the remainder of this sample document is derived from the A.5 Template of SRS Section 3 Organized by Feature shown in the Annex of Std 830-1993. For alternative organizational schemes by system mode, user class, object, stimulus, functional hierarchy, and combinations, see the standard. \\[-0.3cm]

\noindent Provide a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the software. This section should complement the interface descriptions under section 2.1 and should not repeat information there. Include both content and format as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item name of item
	\item description of purpose
	\item source of input or destination of output
	\item valid range, accuracy, and/or tolerance
	\item units of measure
	\item timing
	\item relationships to other inputs/outputs
	\item screen formats/organization
	\item window formats/organization

	\item command formats
	\item end messages
\end{itemize}

\noindent These requirements may be organized in the following subsections. \\[0.1cm]

\section{Funktionale Anforderungen}
This section describes the actual requested user functions of the product and is a refinement of section 2.4.1. These requirements may be listed as “system features” or as use cases, whichever is your preferred method. \\[-0.3cm]

\noindent Anyway the features as well as use cases should be structured according their granularity.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[--] few ''System Features`` containing functional requirements or
	\item[--] very few “summary level” use cases (only needed for large systems) containing more “user-goal level” use cases containing other “function level” use cases below (use a use case template for describing use cases)
	\item[] Alternative:
	\item[--] an alternative to using the use case granularity for structuring the document, is to group it into logical packages (use cases which belong ''somehow`` together)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Feature 1 / Use Case 1}
Repeat subsections at this level and below for each feature. \\[-0.3cm]

\noindent \textit{\large Functional Requirement 1} \\

\begin{itemize}
	\item validity checks on inputs
	\item exact sequencing of operations
	\item responses to abnormal situations, including error handling and recovery
	\item effects of parameters
	\item relationships of inputs to outputs, including input/output sequences and formulas for input to output
